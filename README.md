[00:03.78] She tryna justify her ways (mm-mm-mm)
[00:07.55] I wouldn't judge her by her face
[00:10.34] Not tryna judge, but I rest my case (mm-mm-mm)
[00:14.80] Mm-mm-mm, she ain't no angel, that's all I can say (uh-uh-uh)
[00:21.19] She ain't no angel, that's all I can say
[00:41.19] 
[00:25.33] And I spent two summers bein' on your line, maybe more
[00:28.29] Baby, can you remind?
[00:31.15] Obstacles you would put me through even though it's been overdue, ay
[00:36.72] And if we hold it up any longer, it ain't on me, it ain't on me
[00:41.92] Baby, it's on you, oh-oh, oh
[00:47.23] (Ah-ah-ah)
[00:52.23] 
[00:49.49] She tryna justify her ways (mm-mm-mm)
[00:52.57] I wouldn't judge her by her face
[00:55.55] Not tryna judge, but I rest my case (mm-mm-mm)
[01:00.34] Mm-mmm, she ain't no angel, that's all I can say (uh-uh-uh)
[01:06.12] She ain't no angel, that's all I can say
[01:26.12] 
[01:11.25] And obstacles you put me through, findin' out I can't undo
[01:16.50] Swear my patience's runnin' thin, we're not meant to just stay friends
[01:22.59] Don't say yes girl, just say when
[01:27.86] How long are we gonna pretend?
[01:32.69] (Ah-ah-ah)
[01:37.69] 
[01:34.84] She tryna justify her ways (mm-mm-mm)
[01:38.28] I wouldn't judge her by her face
[01:41.12] Not tryna judge, but I rest my case
[01:45.86] Mm-mm-mm, she ain't no angel, that's all I can say (uh-uh-uh)
[01:52.06] She ain't no angel, that's all I can say
